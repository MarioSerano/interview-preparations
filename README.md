# Interview Preparations

My own personal notes for interview preparations, in hopes this can be the second brain to my coding interview problems.
Going to organize this later but for now I won't be doing much of that! :D

Bear in mind that I primary code with JavaScript/TypeScript, but I'll be doing JavaScript because I currently want to learn JavaScript fundamentals.
