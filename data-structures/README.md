# Data Structures

This folder refers to key concepts that I need to refresh my memory regarding data structures. These information are compiled from things I found from university I attended and the internet. I will not be covering most of the things supported by native JavaScript specifications (arrays, map, set, etc.) because these have already been implemented and I want to learn about the things I forgotten and can implement it using classes/similar things.
