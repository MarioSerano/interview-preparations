# Stack and Queue

## Stack

Stack is a data structure that the accessible data is only the **_most recently inserted_** data. You can imagine a stack of papers that is on the desk, which we can access the top most paper of the stack. This concept is called LIFO (Last In, First Out). There are three main operations on Stack that has O(1) time complexity:

1. push, to put the element on top of the Stack.
2. pop, to remove element from the Stack and returns that item.
3. peek, to see the topmost element of the stack.

## Queue

Queue is a data structure that the accessible data is only the **_least recently inserted_** data. You can imagine a queue of people waiting to get into a room, which the people that can get in first is the first to get in the queue. This concept is called FIFO (First In, First Out). There are three main operations on stack that has O(1) time complexity:

1. enqueue, to put the element into the Queue.
2. dequeue, to remove the element from the Queue and returns that item.
3. peek, to see the front element of that Queue.
